<p>Nowadays, social media has become an integral part of everyday life. Do you want to keep in touch? Letâ€™s follow each other on Instagram! What are you up to? Send me a snap! The amount of time we spend on social media has taken up such a large part of our social life that it is one of the most used ways people connect with each other. </p>

<p>However, social media has offered the opportunity for people to create a carefully crafted online image of themselves rather than reflecting reality. People would only like to post about the highlights of their life, while we oftentimes ignore the mental health issues that lie underneath the filters and follower counts. This would only exacerbate the underlying social hierarchy on digital platforms, which would indirectly lead to social anxiety amongst users and worse mental health issues such as depression. <strong>In this data analysis, we aim to investigate the impact of social media on physical health and mental health, specifically concerning the generation under forty years old. </strong> To back up our analysis, we have gathered and organized three large datasets: <strong>social media usage of 15-40-year-olds in Bangladesh</strong>, <strong>17-22-year-olds in the United States</strong>, and <strong>15-23-year-olds in India during the COVID-19 lockdown</strong>.</p> For each dataset, we will be trying to answer the following questions: How much time do people spend on social media, what are the influences of social media on young people, and what are some mental health influence if people spend more time on social media?
