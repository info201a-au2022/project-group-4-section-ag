1. Although it is not very clear that there is a causal relationship between social media usage and mental health issues, there is an obvious correlational pattern between the two variables. This opens up the possibility that social media might lead to deteriorated mental health, while it could also go the other way around where mental health issues can lead to increased social media usage in seek of comfort, social approval, and company.

2. Going off of the previous point, an expected implication from this data analysis is that social media usage will eventually worsen mental health issues from its basis. According to survey respondents from the Bangladesh dataset, many have reported that they feel anxious or depressed when interacting with social media for a long period of time or at all. The growth from anxiety to depression, which is a worsened stage of mental health, compared with social media usage, proved the point that long hours spent on social media will exacerbate recurring mental health problems.

3. Young adults under the age of 25 are more vulnerable to social media anxiety and depression than other age groups. Drawing from background research, young adults are still developing their understanding of the world and how to build their social circle. Young adults today are born in the 21st century and grew up in an era of technology. According to this data analysis, young adults exhibit more social media usage on average and report worse mental health issues. It is difficult to go through the spiral of mental health issues and the withdrawal period that social media has brought.
