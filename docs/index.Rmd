```{r, include=FALSE}
source("../source/chart_cindy.R")

```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}

```




```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
