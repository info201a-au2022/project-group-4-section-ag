## Abstract

Our main question is **understanding how social media affects our mental health**. This question is important because, in our current generation, almost everyone with technology is exposed to social media. To address this, we will create visuals of patterns and correlations between social media use and user characteristics and trends.

## Introduction

Our project focuses on the effects of social media on mental health. Social media has become very prominent in the last decade creating a place of comfort for some and sadness for others. Through our datasets, we want to showcase how it has affected the majority of the population and create awareness of how much impact social media has on people, especially the current generation that has grown up with exposure to social media. There are different types of social media exposure such as media/current event awareness, lives of individuals, status updates of celebrities, and much more. For many, it may be a personal diary, while others showcase their work. We will be using this project to explore and learn more about these users.

## Problem domain

Over the past decade, social media has been one of the most popular communication tools with approximately 3 billion social media users worldwide. Amongst them, adolescents and young adults are the most active users of social media(Schønning, 2020). From instant messaging to posting life updates, social media allows you not only to share your life with the people you are already close with, but also craft an online image for those who want to get to know you more. This is where the discrepancy lies: an online social media portfolio sometimes does not match how one is like in reality. This leads to teenage problems such as body image issues, imposter syndrome, and comparison of follower counts, which would potentially harm one’s self-esteem and mental health. Research says, “facebook usage increases users' engagement in social comparison and consequently decreases their happiness”(Arad, 2017). These consequences are especially exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic when everyone is isolated in their digital world. Therefore, it is important to investigate the correlation between social media usage and its effects on mental health among teenagers and adolescents.

## Research questions

1. How does social media trends affect the rise or decrease of depression?

- This is the question that is most commonly asked or thought about when using social media. Many parents and guardians don’t allow their children to use social media at a young age because they know of the detrimental effects it can cause to their children.

2. Is there a correlation between the rise of social media usage and teenage mood levels?

- As mentioned in the introduction, social media can bring about happiness or sadness. Which is more prominent is unknown to us which leads us to explore this question with our dataset.

3. Does withdrawal from social media exist and how severe is it?

- Social media is an addiction just like anything else and for every addiction, there may be withdrawals. We want to take a look into what happens after the cease of social media after prolonged use and how it affects individuals differently.

4. How are the young generation, particularly from 17 to 22, influenced by social media both physically and mentally?

- Through data analysis, we wish to understand how social media can influence the physical activities of the young generation. Besides, social media is filled with different information. We want to see how much inappropriate information they have been exposed to that can influence them mentally.

## The dataset

### Dataset 1: Data of Usage of Social Media by Students Between Age 17-22

1. Description:
   This dataset provides data about the time students on social media and on physical activities. By comparing these two categories of data, we can learn if students are getting enough exercise for their physical well-being. Also, we can use this dataset to understand how much inappropriate content they got from the social media platforms they use. If students are getting too much inappropriate information, it can also influence their mental health condition.

2. Provenance:
   Maheep Mahat was the creator of this dataset in 2018. There aren’t any people funded for this project. The creator of this project seems to be the only person who benefits from this data. The disappointing news is that we are not sure of either the source or how the creator got this data. Therefore, this data can be not trustworthy. I obtained the data by simply downloading it.

### Data Set 2: Data of Social Media Usage Concerning the Young Generation (15-40 years old) in Bangladesh

1. Description:
   This dataset provides information about the social media usage among adolescents. By organizing the information and sorting the observations into age groups, it is possible to find the correlation between mental health and social media usage. The data provided are qualitative and quantitative data that is possible to make inferences about the effects of social media.

2. Provenance:
   Researchers from the University of Asia Pacific, Dhaka, have collected data from across Bangladesh. The dataset is the raw data that researchers have collected to investigate how mental health problems in the young generation in Bangladesh correlate to their social media usage. The data collected were responses to self-reported questionnaires using Google Surveys. The questionnaire was sent to participants through digital communication tools such as e-mail, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, etc. Though participants weren’t filtered and it was a random sample of subjects who are willing to participate, the dataset is supplementary to the research questions that were being proposed due to the large sample size and the wide range of backgrounds of participants.

### Data Set 3: Effect of social media on mental health during Covid-19 lockdowns in India

1. Description:
   This dataset provides information about the social media usage of adults in India during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. By organizing this data with respect to the age groups, it is possible to infer the correlation between mental health issues and social media usage in adolescents. However, the data might have a potential bias as in the participants were in lockdown. The isolation factor might also contribute as a factor to the mental health issues, which would be difficult to make inferences with basic sorting and filtering techniques.

2. Provenance:
   This dataset is collected by researchers Saptorshi Gupta and Ayan Ganguly. The objective of this dataset is to analyze both the positive and negative effects of social media usage on individuals in India during a global lockdown. It is specifically concerned with second deadly COVID-19 pandemic wave in India and to understand the extent of depression and anxiety caused by social media and the lockdown. The data is collected by sending questionaires to participants during the lockdown through online platforms, without specific samples as to the socioeconomic status of the participants.

## Expected Implications

One expected implication would be that social media usage would lead to a decline in mental health in adolescents. The results from researching this dataset can be used by medical professionals or therapists, who would take into account the social media factor when diagnosing teenagers with mental health issues.
Another expected implication would depend on the type of social media and how the effects vary across the spectrum. For instance, social media such as Instagram and Snapchat that require constant interaction would possibly have a greater impact on one’s mental health than other low-maintenance social media applications such as Tik Tok. This would provide food for thought for further research into which factors in social media would lead to the common mental health issues teenagers normally experience.

## Limitations

Some limitations that we may have for this problem and the dataset is the vast amount of data we have with different variables for each dataset. There’s not a condensed dataset of one specific topic which can limit what findings we can gather after graphing. Additionally, mental health can be subjective. Everyone feels and rates themselves at a different scale which can cause a lot of variance in our calculations. Although the general trend will be the same, it can cause some dissonance.

### Dynamic Paragraph

```{r, echo = FALSE}
source("./source/summary_info.R")
summary_info
```

In this analysis, summary statistics were computed using the largest dataset of the project to find the relationship between social media usage among youth and their mental well-being. We used data such as inappropriate content, the amount of time spent on social media, preferred method of communication, etc. Among all 291 observations in the dataset, the youngest participants are two 14-year-old teenagers, and the oldest participants are eight 23-year-old youths. From the summary conclusion, it was found that participants who felt the most exposed to inappropriate content on social media mainly used Whatsapp and Instagram. However, most of them only use social media for less than 2.5 hours per day. It was also found that older participants in this data-collection process prefer face-to-face and phone communication instead of text messages.


## Table

```{r, echo = FALSE}
source("./source/table.R")
final_table
```

This table shows how 291 young people between the age of 14 and 23 used social media in 2018. On average, most young people use more than 2 social media platforms. On a scale from one to ten, most teenagers rate themselves a number between 3 to 6 in terms of the amount of inappropriate content they were exposed to on their social media platforms. The last interesting observation is young people's time on social media and exercise. Of all 291 people between 14 and 23, nobody spent more time on exercise than that on social media. On average, people between 18 and 21 spent at least one more hour on social media compared to exercise. I want to include this table because this table shows the negative impact of social media on young people both mentally and physically.

## Chart 1

```{r, echo = FALSE}
source("./source/chart_cindy.R")
social_media_versus_exercise_plot
```

This graph shows how young people of different ages spent time on social media relative to exercise. Particularly, this bar plot reveals the relationship between time difference with age. The chart is a bell-like shape, and it is mostly normal-distributed. Young people between 18 and 21 spend more time on social media than on exercise. On the other hand, the people younger and older than them have a slightly more balanced time usage. I include this graph because it clearly revealed how people of different ages use social media.

## Chart 2

```{r, echo = FALSE}
source("./source/chart_haipei.R")
age_versus_number_of_sm_plot

```

This visualization is a scatterplot of the number of social media platforms 14 to 23-year-olds own. From the scatterplot, there isn’t a significant correlation between age and the number of platforms. However, it was shown that youth above 19 generally use social media platforms more than those under 19. There is especially a spike in the number of ages 21-23 which emphasizes the main audience of different medias. It purposefully visualizes different distributions of media and age. 

## Chart 3
```{r, echo=FALSE}
source("./source/chart_hui.R")
age_versus_inappropriate_content_degree
```

In the plot of age vs. the degree of inappropriate content, there isn't a very significant coefficient for the trend, however, this consistency may tell us about the trajectory and content on social media. There is a subtle increase in the degree of severity as the kid ages which may be proportional to their maturity and what they perceive to be inappropriate mentally. This helps gives us insight of how social media affects the mental of the users. Furthermore, the average degree hovers around four out of ten. There lacks data of 15 year olds thus an outlier, but from this data, media filters should be implemented for the younger audience to help reduce the number. 

## Findings:
 
1. How does social media trends affect the rise or decrease of depression?  
Although there is no clear trend of a cause-and-effect relationship between social media and depression, it can be deduced that social media is one of the factors in worsening the mental health issues that previously exist. In the Bangladesh dataset, survey respondents individually reported their level of social anxiety and depression within a period of time. While social anxiety can vary on different levels, some reported that they have experienced depression more than anxiety, correlating to the high amount of social media usage they’ve had.

2. Is there a correlation between the rise of social media usage and teenage mood levels?  
According to the data analysis, the average more time people spend on social media, the more negative mood levels they will experience. The difference between the teenage generation and earlier generations is that teenagers nowadays spend more time on social media platforms rather than connecting with their peers in person. In addition, study shows that young adults are the most vulnerable to mood swings because they are still in the stage of developing an understanding of the world. Therefore, social media usage could be a great factor that impacts teenage mood levels.

3. Does withdrawal from social media exist and how severe is it?  
Withdrawal from social media does exist, but different age groups exhibit different reactions to withdrawal. According to the “Effects of Social Media on Mental Health” dataset, it is shown that there is a peak in social media usage, but after a certain period of time the average number of hours will go down by approximately 2.5 hours. Young adults might experience more of a withdrawal effect than older generations because of how prominent social media is in our life, especially added on to peer pressure in school. However, older millennials usually exhibit a stable social media usage pattern, but this varies from person to person depending on how familiar they are with technology. This is shown in the “Ages vs. Hours” interactive chart as the line fluctuates very often.

4. How is the young generation, particularly from 17 to 22,  influenced by social media both physically and mentally?   
Although social media has been a growing platform that provides users with a lot of updated information, it would have negative effects on young adults both physically and mentally. According to the youth analysis interactive chart, the young generation of ages 17 to 22 have spend an average of 1.22 more hours on social media than exercising. This shows that social media is taking away the time young adults spend outdoors doing physical activities. Mentally, survey respondents in the dataset reported that they have experienced more negative emotions of social media than positive emotions. Most of the common answers collected were feelings of isolation, anxiety, and even depression.

## Discussion:
This study on social media and its negative effects raise an important question of the ethics and purpose of social media, or even the advancement of technology. Nowadays, there are many social media platforms that people use. Facebook was founded in 2004, Instagram was founded six years after, and now we have Snapchat and BeReal… approximately every ten years, a new digital platform will blow up with newcoming generation. However, many features on these platforms are designed to get people addicted. For example, the for-you pages we see on our feed is generated by the social media algorithm, and it curates content that would get you hooked on your phone for the next two hours. The interactive design of these applications creates such smooth communication features that would give users a comfortable environment to express themselves. This not only is one of the causes for high social media usage, but it also restricts users in their own comfort zones of their own knowledge, preventing progress in society.   
Going off of the previous point, this also raises concerns about the deteriorating mental health in the young generations. Adolescence and adulting is a special time where young adults form an understanding of the world. They grow physically, socially, and emotionally, whilst they are also exposed to the cruel side of the world like poverty, abuse, etc. Adolescence is a very vulnerable period of time, and young adults would need the support from friends and family. However, social media has increased the severity their mood swings as well as emotional stability, which is a concern for stakeholders such as influencers, content creators, and social media companies.   
So with all of these considerations, does this mean that we should complete cut out social media? The answer is no. The implication of this study is that we would have to go into social media with the correct mindset and habits While social media has led to many mental health issues, it is also a digital platform that allows users to explore current trends, get updated on the most recent news, and stay connected with their closest friends. It is important to acknowledge that social media, like all other entertainment activities, should have a limit in which you should hold yourself accountable. Whether its screen time or a change in mindset, it is important to use social media as a healthy tool to connect and explore.   

## Conclusion: 
  Throughout this research, we analyzed datasets and cited previous studies to prove that social media has exacerbated people’s preexisting mental health issues. It is important to acknowledge the negative impact and take action accordingly to counter these issues. Social media allows people to create an online profile for themselves, but this sometimes gives people unrealistic views of others’ lives, which lead to problems of comparing one to another. Here, it is important to have a correct mindset and acknowledge the fact that the things people post are only a small part of their life. We don’t see how people are struggling behind the flawless filters and curated captions.   
	In addition, social media has also been a distraction and disruption to a healthy lifestyle. Features such as for-you pages would only distract one briefly from reality and take away time from one which they can use it better to advance themselves. It is necessary to understand and have a limit of how much time one spends on social media in order to block out the distractions. On the other hand, research shows that bluelight from electronic devices would disrupt one’s sleeping pattern and make it more difficult to fall asleep, which indirectly impacts our physical health as well.  
	With all the factors added up, it is not surprising that social media would be one of the factors that lead to anxiety and depression. Therefore, it is important to understand the pros of social media, or even seek alternative solutions to take your time away from social media. For instance, social media is a great tool to build online communities without the restriction of geographical boundaries. People get exposed to new hobbies, or even find a friend from another country that has the same interests as them. This could be helpful for those who experience exclusion or disabilities, where they are incapable of getting out of their comfort zone and having an enjoyable social life.   
	In addition, social media can also be used for self-expression and entertainment. Many people showcase their interests on social media by posting photos and videos of their progress, which will also attract other people to explore these new activities. Entertainment resources online is also a great way to take a break from reality, which is beneficial for mental health problems such as anxiety and depression.  
	In short, while social media has influenced one’s mental health in one way another, it is in fact a creative and advanced communication tool in the 21st century. In order to combat these negative influences, we should do our part to use social media as a tool that would help us learn and grow.
