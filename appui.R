        36 years old and 53 years old with an average of 5 hours of social media usage. 
        The average social media usage of people under the age of 35 was fairly stable, 
        while the standard deviation of social media usage above that age was much greater. 
        This shows that older peopleâ€™s social media behaviors vary drastically from person 
        to person, while young adults grew up with technology and exhibit the same patterns.
